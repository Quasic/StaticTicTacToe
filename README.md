This is part of a game study, but also the game, itself. It's playable in pretty much any browser, even simple text browsers, (no JavaScript or plugins required,) with nothing but a read-only file server.

## Winning
In regular games, with either you or the computer going first, the computer is unbeatable. The best you can do is tie. However, with certain easier setups, including the option for the computer to play completely for you, there are 5 ways to win.
